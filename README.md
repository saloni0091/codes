Round Robin Scheduler

It is one of the algorithms employeedby processes and network schedulers in comuting.
As the term is generally used time slices or time quantum is allocateed to every process in equal portions and in circular order.
handling all processes without priority

Problem statement

We have to write a code which will act like a scheduler, program will read an input filenamed assign-1.ip.It will be a comma seperated
file containing a table .When we will run the program it will ask for the length of the quantum.When we enter the value ,it will schedule
 the job according to that quantum and save the order in which they execute into a comma seperated file named assign-1.op.
 
 How to run :
 
 As it is the program of linux ,so we need a linux operating system to execute it like ubuntu etc, in order to open it we can use any eeditor like notepad
